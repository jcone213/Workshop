## Anderson and Kitchin Reading Response

The main idea Anderson discusses in his reading is that there is a new era coming into our world which is the Petabyte Age. Since technology has grown immensely in the past decade or two, Anderson believes that with all the access to big data, the scientific method is becoming less and less useful. He goes into more detail by saying that some algorithms and machine learning techniques no longer require an intense level of thinking. Contrary to Anderson, Kitchin believes that all of this big data is allowing us to reach a fourth paradigm. He states that the big data is not destroying theories, it is supplementing to our knowledge of the scientific method in order to improve research methods and questions. While Anderson does make some good points about his point of view of big data, I agree more with Kitchin's way of thinking. I beleive that with new data and new data gatering methods, we can only improve our scientific method. Technology can be seen as troublesome or maybe in the way sometimes, but the generations born today will be well versed in all of the new tech which will lead to more discoveries and research methods.
