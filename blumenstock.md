## Blumenstock Response

  Blumenstock claims that a humbler data science is the key to international development. In his argument he makes a promise that within a few years we should be able to track the effects of natural disasters much faster than ever before. We could track where people could migrate to in order to be safe from that disaster. This would all be possible through people's cell phones. I think it is neccessary for people to be on board with having their satallite location visible to scientists in order to ensure their safety in the event of a natural disaster or other dangers. 
  
  There are certainly pitfalls with Blumentsock's promise, which he explains in the reading. These pitfalls are as follows; unanticipated effects, lack of validation, biased algorithms, and lack of regulation. Some of the unanticipated effects could be that areas with low income will not have the resources or wealth to get the benefits of this satellite tracking tecnology. For the lack of validation, some people will try to try to 'game the system' when they realize that they are being monitered because they know that some people will be eligible for aid while others will not be. The biased algorithms pitfall is referring to higher income societies versus low income societies. Apps like gogogle maps and waze only work on smartphones, benefiting people of high income. Technology works much better with connectivity so it is a fact that low income societies with have less connectivity in turn getting less aid. Lastly, there would be no regulation because the surpreme court made a law that says companies cannot posess mobile phone data without a warrant which will hinder many companies trying to gather big data. 
  
  Blumenstock gives examples of steps that could be taken in order to move forward. One of these steps is validating the information. Once they gather information from big-data applications it is neccessary to compare that information to older data sets in order to validate and update maps. Another step that could be taken is to customize the technology to benefit third world societies. Most technology is designed to help first world countries with their connectivity and resources which leaves third world societies behind.
