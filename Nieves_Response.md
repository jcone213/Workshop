## Nieves Response

#### Nieves et a. use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally?  Describe in detail how random forest works.  What is a dasymmetric population allocation? Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside?

In the Nieves et al. reading, The authors use a machine learning method called random forest in order to predict global population density based on different types of covariates. Random forest is a classification algorithm that combines many different decision trees to form a 'forest' of data sets layered on top of eacother. It also uses bagging and implements randomness in order to ensure a higher level of accuracy with predictions. Dasymetric population allocation gathers more accurate population data by creating certain borders for different areas. In other words, it accurately distributes data to grid cells and these allocated borders. As mentioned in the reading, the most important geospatial covariates to consider when predicting global values were climate or environmental. Other important variables were related to built or urban areas.
