## Analysis of Different Geospatial Data Science Methods Predicting Migration Patterns Post Natural Disaster in Columbia. 
#### By: Jack Cone

### **Introduction**

Natural disasters have been an easy way to cripple a country’s economy and its people ever since the dawn of time. Nowadays, countries with higher incomes can build stronger infrastructure or have better protocols in place if ever a disaster occurs. This would reduce the effects to the people and economy. However, in low-to-middle income countries like Columbia don’t have these resources so they are at a much larger risk of dangers from a disaster. Some of these risks for the citizens include loss of homes, jobs, distance from families, injury, and death. The geospatial data science method I chose to relate to this topic was population mapping using call detail record data and the random forest algorithm. This means that the population of Columbia would be mapped out in order to find certain issues that could be resolved like where people could live short term after their homes were destroyed. Also, if a large amount of people is seen to be overcrowded, new people would not be sent to this location. One way that mobile phone data is being used today is with all the stay in home orders with the Coronavirus pandemic. Researchers can see which states have been following these guidelines and which states have not. My central research question is as follows; Between CDR data and Random Forest, which data science method is more effective in predicting migration patterns in Columbia after a natural disaster?
  
## **Inquiry Type** 

Regarding my central research question stated above, I believe it is an evaluative question. The inquiry is evaluating two different data science methods and comparing both of their effectiveness of predicting migration patterns. I am not trying to describe or explain how something in human development happens, rather I am exploring two different methods and how they affect human life. Some sub research questions that can be asked are, how can CDR data and random forest data be used to make accurate maps of a population? How long does it take for these maps to take shape? Both questions will help lead to an answer for the big research question by breaking it down into smaller bits. 
  
## **Methods** 

Knowing where citizens of a country are at all times would be quite convenient and at the same time intrusive of human privacy. This is why we need to get the data using other methods like call detail records or the random forest algorithm. CDR data is simply a record of all calls made by a population showing certain categories like place and time. An example of this record can be seen in Figure 3. By using these methods researchers can get a clearer picture as to where people are residing or migrating in real time. Random forest is more of a newer machine learning algorithm used in mapping whereas CDR data has been used to track human mobility more specifically in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Researchers Lu, Bengtsson, and Holme used CDR data to monitor mobility of Haitians during this time. In order to get the information of the population, researchers needed to team up with Digicel, a cell service in Haiti, to gain access to citizens locations. They tracked 1.9 million people from 42 days before the earthquake to 341 days after the earthquake. What they saw 19 days after the earthquake was a 23% decrease in the population of the capital Port-au-Prince. They also saw that people’s distance moved and their movement trajectories both grew. One of the methods they also used was a radius of gyration. The gyration equation took in all cell tower data and showed an individual’s trajectory in a specific period.

The other method, random forest, is a machine learning algorithm used in dasymetric map making of any variable or a combination of variables. Using satellite images, the algorithm can will look at each grid cell usually 100m x 100m and determine if a structure or object occurs in that frame. Adding another covariate will then make the algorithm look at every grid cell again for another thing layering on the layer below it. This algorithm could be very good at assessing damages after a disaster or seeing any new temporary shelters popping up around an area. Research done by Forrest R. Stevens, Andrea E. Gaughan, Catherine Linard, and Andrew J. Tatem shows how random forest is used in population mapping. In Figure 2, it shows a map of Kenya that went through random forest to show population density in the country. Later in the article they compared their data to AfriPop data and the random forest data had a much lower percentage of error in more areas across Kenya.  

## **Conclusion and Discussion**

Researchers have showed with much evidence that these two methods, CDR data and random forest, can be used for human mobility mapping. The question remains which method will suit better for a post natural disaster situation. CDR data seems to have the upper hand due to its relationship if you will with the citizens of the country. Random forest is a machine learning algorithm looking for buildings or landmarks in order to make a map. So, when thinking about human mobility, the data set that involves human connection seems to make sense. However, there is still the problem with technology not working in times we need it most. Can we really expect a majority of Columbians to have a working phone to call with after a disaster? Phone lines may be damaged, people may not be able to charge their devices or become disconnected from it if they lose it. Another problem with the research is determining who needs help the most. That is great if we know where everyone is and moving to, but if we give help to a certain group that is healthy and well while another is struggling to survive or find their families we have failed. There remains a question of how to determine who needs support the most.
