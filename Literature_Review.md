#### <div align="center"> By: Jack Cone

### **Introduction**

The purpose of this research is to improve up the use of CDR data to form a better understanding of human migration patterns after a natural disaster. This will be done by comparing more recent Data Science methods like CDR data or the Random Forest machine learning algorithm against older, slower methods like survey or census data. After an even such as a natural disaster, the response must be given in a timely manner or lives may be lost or families could be separated. The areas that must be focused on are migration patterns/predictions and getting supplies or food to those who need it most. I will achieve this goal through meeting the following objectives.

1.	Use of CDR data to map out human migration patterns.
2.	Use of machine learning algorithms like random forest to have a more detailed picture of the country.
3.	Equip response teams with the proper knowledge on who needs the most support or food in a certain region.

This research will build upon the previous work from authors such as Wilson, Hong, Lu, and Bengtsson and will incorporate new methods to implement a more detailed approach to responding to future natural disasters. [3][9][10] The older ways of doing this research is just simply not fast enough to keep up with today's methods and research. Other areas of research may still be able to use surveys or census data but if lives are in danger, these new data science methods must be used.
 

### **Human Development Topic**

Natural disasters have always been some of Earth’s most dangerous, harmful, and sometimes unexpected events to ever happen to humans. These disasters can easily cripple a nation’s economy or tear families apart if they are not prepared. These effects only get amplified when the disasters occur in a low-middle income country such as Columbia. Columbia, on the northern border of South America, is placed near a continental plate. This is bad news for the residents because they are at a much higher risk of becoming victims of earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. The main problem with responding to natural disasters is the quickness and accuracy of it all. High income countries will still face a lot of damage, but they will recover much faster than low-middle income countries. One of the tools that can be utilized for a fast and reliable response is CDR data. Call Data Records will be able to map out accurately in real time where citizens in danger are and in turn allowing them to be redirected to safety. Another way to improve help for people is by looking at past events to try and notice trends that could make future responses better. Disasters could be completely random with little to no warning making the responses as important if not more important than preventing them.

Amartya Sen, an Indian economist and philosopher, defines human development as “The enhancement of freedoms that allow people to lead lives that they have reason to value” The topic of disaster response is directly related to Amartya Sen's definition of human development. It is a little different however because in other cases, a population may be living their everyday lives without freedoms. People in a low to middle income country such as Columbia experience this too, but when a natural disaster strikes, their situation could only get worse. When a high-income society such as the United States of America becomes victim to a disaster, they might face a higher level of economic loss at first, but their ability to recover faster is due directly to the fact that they have a much more stable economy. The main reason for this research is not only to prevent deaths, but to allow people to gain back whatever freedoms they had before the disaster in a timely manner.
In terms of the Sustainable Development Goals highlighted by the United Nations, this topic is not in direct relation to one goal per say. However, it reaches out to some individual goals such as good health and well-being, or industry, innovation, and infrastructure. 

### **Human Development Process**

Columbia is a country located on the northern coast of South America. The country is bordered by three tectonic plates that all meet along the western coast. These plates are the Caribbean plate, the Cocos plate, and the Nazca plate. This means that Earthquakes are not an uncommon thing in Columbia. Since 1950 more than 3500 people died by direct consequences of earthquakes. [6] Compared to the United States which has many more people, the amount of deaths due to Earthquakes over the last 70 years in at least 3000 less. The reasons behind this could be that Columbia's infrastructure is a lot less sustainable or durable to withstand high magnitude earthquakes. Also because of Columbia's low income, the resources post disaster is not going to be near what other countries have to offer. Looking at the population density, according to world pop as of 2020, Columbia has a higher majority of its citizens living on the northern coast or in the mid-west. [7] This happens to be where most of the biggest earthquakes occur. Though it is not as common it is still possible for a volcano to erupt as there are 4 which are active in Columbia. Tsunamis are also able to happen due to close proximity of fault lines. The process of responding to a disaster starts with where it happens. Once that is known, by using random forest data we can see the population that will be affected firsthand. Then by using CDR data or gravity models we can try to plan or predict where most people will try to migrate to in order to become safe. After a couple days or weeks, it is then necessary to locate people who need shelter, food, or life support.

The issues seen in the process lie mainly in the fact that it is difficult to track human migration patterns especially after a horrible event that can cause catastrophic damage. Also these migrations can make it much harder for relief teams to reach those who are in need of help. Understanding the migration patterns could mean the difference for those who may have ended up somewhere they aren’t supposed to be. When looking at the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, at first the CDR data was not proving to be reliable for predicting migration patterns. However, after about 3 months, the migrations were able to be predicted at much higher level which is promising. [9]

### **Geospatial Data Science Methods**

The most useful Data Science method used for this topic has to be mapping. Creating maps that have everything from disaster risk levels, to population distribution, or even types of homes that people live in are all useful. One way of gathering the data for these maps is by using CDR data. CDR data or call detail record is just a record of metadata that includes many different categories. Some of these categories are where a call was made, when the call was made, where the call was going, etc. This data is most useful during holiday seasons or right after a disaster. During these times people call whoever they are closest to. This could give researchers useful data as to where people are who are still stuck in an inhabitable area after an earthquake. Some problems with CDR data within respect of Columbia are that there may not be as many cell phones to make calls. Another flaw is that after a disaster, phone lines or connection cables could be destroyed or hindered by debris.
