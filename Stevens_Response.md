In the reading today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works?

The technique the authors used to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe was called Random Forest. Random Forest is a data science machine learning algorithm that uses multiple covariates or independent variables to provide a more narrow view of population density in this case.

The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events?

A machine learning algorithm uses data gathered into a model which in turn will make predictions about a population density. This data science machine learning technique is different from classical statistical approaches because it has the ability to be much more elaborate and detailed in its methods.

In the reading, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions?

Covariates is just another term used for an independent variable of some sort. In the reading the authors used geospatial covariates such as late night lights, temperature or other geological factors in order to make different layers for a map. Big data is crucial in order to make more precise predictions about a population. If the random forest algorithm only uses a few covariates the percentage of error may be much higher then expected. 

The authorsâ€™ results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth?

The significance of having an accurate description of where each perosn is located is extraordinary. This can help in a lot of circumstances such as natural disasters or pandemics as we are seeing today. This accurate data could also show a correlation between population density and effects on the environment. 

Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?

This method of Random forest is highly useful in my topic which is disaster relief. At first I was only focused on CDR data in order to see where most of the population is but the Random Forest algorithm is proven to be accurate and detailed with the locations of people in a country. The data would also show how close certain groups of people are to unstable geological locations across the country.
