# Agent Based Models 

### Introduction

My name is Jack Cone and I am a senior at William and Mary. My major is Data Science with a concentration in Algorithms. I enjoy playing baseball, watching movies and tv shows, and also listening to music. As a little intro project, below is the plot that I made in R representing a person's path as they visit certain homes on a route.
