##Problem Statement

Natural disasters have always been some of Earth’s most dangerous, harmful, and sometimes unexpected events to ever happen to humans. These disasters can easily cripple a nation's economy or tear families apart if they are not prepared. These effects only get amplified when the disasters occur in a low-middle income country such as Columbia. Columbia, on the northern border of South America, is placed in close proximity to a continental plate. This is bad news for the residents because they are at a much higher risk of becoming victims of earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. The main problem with responding to natural disasters is the quickness and accuracy of it all. High income countries will still face a lot of damage, but they will recover much faster than low-middle income countries. One of the tools that can be utilized for a fast and reliable response is CDR data. Call Data Records will be able to map out accurately in real time where citizens in danger are and in turn allowing them to be redirected to safety. Another way to improve help for people is by looking at past events to try and notice trends that could make future responses better. Disasters could be completely random with little to no warning making the responses as important if not more important than preventing them.

This article just describes the basics of using mobile phone data for the improvement of emergency response to natural disasters. There are many advantages which stick out. These advantages are that the data is abundant, timely, and requires no dedicated survey or collection effort. The method for gathering migration patterns with call data records requires looking at one person's records not the whole population. The only way to see change in movement is to narrow the search to groups. One huge disadvantage for using mobile phone data for disaster response is that the phone lines could be damaged easily making the data extremely hard to retrieve if at all. Another downfall is that in high density areas it is much harder to track migration patterns. On the subject of migration patterns, if citizens are required to cross borders into another country, their cell service may not allow for calls to be made outside of their own country which would limit data. The last downfall discussed in the article is how some phone companies are biased away from women, the poor, young, or the elderly in other countries. There wasn’t much talk about human development in the article. It was mainly about the pros and cons of gathering data post natural disaster. Bengtsson and colleagues have shown that with an increase in mobile phones in the world, disaster response will substantially improve in the future. I chose this article to cover how CDR data can actually be used for tracking human migration patterns. Without this information the data would be harder to understand or decipher any patterns at all.

The main point of this article was to discuss how a population can migrate or be displaced after a natural disaster. In this case they were looking at Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. Most of the time any severe disaster will cause some sort of movement with the population. These movements can make it much harder for relief teams to reach those who are in need of help. Understanding the migration patterns could mean the difference for those who may have ended up somewhere they aren’t supposed to be. In order to get the information of the population, researchers needed to team up with Digicel, a cell service in Haiti, to gain access to citizens locations. They tracked 1.9 million people from 42 days before the earthquake to 341 days after the earthquake. What they saw 19 days after the earthquake was a 23% decrease in the population of the capital Port-au-Prince. They also saw that people’s distance moved and their movement trajectories both grew. Contrary to what people would believe but with all of this extra movement from the population, the movement never became unpredictable. In fact the predictability of the movement actually increased during a three month period after the earthquake. A conclusion from these studies, that is quite different from other research, is that migration of individuals was surprisingly predictable which is important in disaster planning and response for the future. Also, the post disaster reconstruction programs in the long run, led to more people returning to affected areas than staying away. With accurate data, reconstruction plans can be very successful and lead to affected areas being nicer than they were pre-disaster, drawing even more people back.

I chose this article because it had some excellent graphics and details on all natural disasters. Another reason was because their data was customizable so I could change it to show only data from Columbia or compare it to another country. The data goes up to the year 2017 which is fairly new and updated. One of the main graphs I used when researching was the ‘Deaths from natural disasters as a share of total deaths’ one. This is where I found that Columbia had one of the highest percentages of deaths from natural disasters compared to other countries at 0.15%. I then learned that Columbia is at a much larger risk for disasters because of its location on the pacific ring of fire. The article offered another great graph that showed the estimated total number of people displaced by a disaster in that year for a country. This data is useful because the whole point of disaster response is getting people to where they belong and not be abandoned somewhere they are not supposed to be. The article also has a great history side to it. Some of the graphs have data from about 4 thousand years ago to the present. They also record where the deadliest earthquakes have happened on Earth. Another cool feature is that I have the ability to see how many deaths per country based on what kind of disaster in a certain year. I could go on and on about all of the statistics that this article has like economic loss, response time for a country, media response time to a disaster per country. This is one of the most valuable sources simply because of how versatile it is.
